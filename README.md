Created the table which contains employee #, name, title, from date, and salary using right join command. Exported the table into a csv file. In addtion, created a query which would return a list of current employees could be retired and their most recent titles to find out new potential mentors.

Listed the count of employee titles in descending order. Made partitions in the data to make sure there will be no duplicates and to reach the final list with the most recent titles. Using query that would return how many current employees of each title are eligible for retirement.

Set up birth date from 01/01/1965 to 12/31/1965 and found employees who would be ready for a mentorship;created a new table. Only current employees were included. Using the final query to reach the data contains potential mentor's employee #, name, title, birth date, and employement date.
